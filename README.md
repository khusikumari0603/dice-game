The Dice Android Game or also a game of Pig is a jeopardy dice game where the main aim of the player is to score 100 points by themselves. Each player’s turn in the game consists of repeatedly rolling a die. After each roll, the player is faced with two options: whether to roll again, or hold (decline to roll again).
